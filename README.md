# DuckDB + Soda Integration Test

This repository contains an experimental setup to test and evaluate the integration between DuckDB and Soda Core for data quality validation.

The goal of this project is to understand how Soda checks can be executed on top of DuckDB datasets and to assess the behavior, limitations, and usability of this integration in a local analytical environment.

## Project Scope

- Test Soda Core checks using DuckDB as the execution engine
- Validate common data quality rules such as null checks, row count checks, and basic consistency validations
- Explore how DuckDB and Soda integrate in practice

## Tech Stack

- Python
- DuckDB
- Soda Core
- Jupyter Notebook
